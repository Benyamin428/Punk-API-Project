Punk API Project

This was a React based project that involved fetching content from a third party provider. The key concepts involved in this project was a good grasp of state changes and dealing with them using the React UseState and UseEffect hooks. In addition, an understanding of asychronous functions was needed in order to perform the fetch API request.

I have also included some tests using the React Testing library to check if the components were able to successfully render on screen and also see if the API contents were able to load on the page.
